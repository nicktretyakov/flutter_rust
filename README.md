Features

Seamless integration between Flutter/Dart and Rust
Support for synchronous and asynchronous Rust functions
Automatic code generation for FFI bindings (if applicable)
Cross-platform compatibility
Extensive documentation and example code
Modular architecture for easy maintenance and extension

Architecture
The architecture typically involves:

Flutter/Dart Frontend: Manages the user interface and interactions.
Rust Backend: Handles performance-critical logic, computations, or data processing.
Bridge/Interface: Facilitates communication between Dart and Rust, often via Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

This separation allows developers to focus on efficient Rust code while leveraging Flutter's UI capabilities.
Installation
To get started, follow these steps:

Install Flutter: Follow the official Flutter installation guide for your platform.
Install Rust: Install Rust using rustup.
Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/nicktretyakov/flutter_rust.git
cd flutter_rust


Build the Rust Library: Navigate to the Rust directory (e.g., rust/) and run:cargo build --release


Integrate with Flutter: Link the Rust library with your Flutter app per project-specific instructions (e.g., copying the library or configuring build scripts).
Run the Flutter App:flutter run



Note: Exact steps may vary. Refer to the repository's README for specifics.
Usage
To use Rust functions in Flutter:

Define Rust functions with #[no_mangle] and pub extern "C".
Use Dart's FFI to load the library and call functions.
Pass and receive data as needed.

Example
Rust Code (e.g., rust/src/lib.rs):
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

Dart Code (e.g., lib/main.dart):
import 'dart:ffi';
import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart';

typedef AddFunc = Int32 Function(Int32 a, Int32 b);
typedef DartAddFunc = int Function(int a, int b);

final dylib = DynamicLibrary.open('path/to/librustlib.so');
final add = dylib.lookupFunction<AddFunc, DartAddFunc>('add');

void main() {
  print('2 + 3 = ${add(2, 3)}');  // Outputs: 5
}

Refer to project examples for complex interactions.

Troubleshooting

Build Errors: Ensure dependencies and Rust toolchain are up to date.
Linking Issues: Verify library build and path in Flutter project.
Memory Management: Handle memory allocation/deallocation to avoid leaks.

Performance Tips

Minimize Data Copying: Use zero-copy techniques.
Leverage Concurrency: Use Rust's async or multi-threading for heavy tasks.
Profile Code: Identify and optimize bottlenecks.

Best Practices

Modular Code: Keep Rust code testable independently.
Error Handling: Propagate errors meaningfully to Dart.
Documentation: Document Rust functions for Dart usage.
